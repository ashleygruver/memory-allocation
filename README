Jacob - Regular Heap management
Heap edge cases:
Heap sizes are rounded up to the nearest multiple of 8
A heap cannot be allocated without at least 24 bytes of memory allocated. Attempts to do so will result in Init returning without
initilizing the heap
Attempts to Malloc 0 bytes will result in a null pointer return
Any free blocks of 8 bytes will be incorperated as internal fragmentation
All alignment based fragmentation is internal to the 
Size in the header and footer includes the header and footer size. e.g. if i points to the header, i+size points to the header of the next element in the heap.
When passed a null pointer, free and get will do nothing, when passed a pointer that is neither null nor a valid free target, behavior is unpredictable

Heap checker edge cases:
The Heapchecker may fail in heaps larger than 1024KB
Any processes needed for the Heapchecker are excluded from the time counter
Allocated heap size does not include data structures. Only allocated bytes and internal fragmentation
All alignment fragmentation is internal, therefore total free bytes and raw free bytes are the same value
Failed mallocs and frees are included in the time average
Average times will not print if there have been no calls
